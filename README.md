Hybrid
======

A hybrid application that contains social-network Apps(HTML5) like Facebook, Twitter, Sina-Weibo, QQ-Weibeo in a WebView.  Users do not have to afford the risk that some nativ Apps will read private data or invade privacy. App provides basic functions to share text and attachments(media, image etc). It is a light way to share in social instead of installing a complex nativ App.
